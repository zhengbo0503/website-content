Here is a set of notes that I typesetted during my study.

***If you are not comfortable with sharing these materials, please
contact me to remove them.***

## Reading 

- [[PDF](notes_files/quadconvjacobi.pdf)] Briefly discuss the history of the development of the **quadratic convergence** of both the *classical* and *cyclic* Jacobi algorithm. 
- [[PDF](notes_files/lapack-eigen-svd-solver.pdf)] [LAPACK](https://netlib.org/lapack/) Eigen/SVD Solvers based on [GMS22](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.04626) and [ZB22](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.03339). 
- [[PDF](notes_files/syleqn.pdf)] Basic introduction on the iterations for the [Sylvester equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sylvester_equation). 
- [[PDF](notes_files/ggsss2013.pdf)] Gene Golub SIAM Summer School 2013, Function of Matrices: This short course is taught by Professor Nicholas J. Higham. The notes is a edited version of both handout and the slides. For more materials of this course including codes, exercises and solutions, please direct to [ggsss2013](https://www.maths.manchester.ac.uk/~higham/misc/ggsss13.php). The whole summer school is recorded by the Fudan University and they are available [here](https://archive.siam.org/students/g2s3/2013/course.html). 

## Course

- Advanced Uncertainty Quantification
  ([PDF](notes_files/advanced_uq.pdf)): This course is lectured by
  [Professor Catherine
  Powell](https://personalpages.manchester.ac.uk/staff/Catherine.Powell/)
  during **2021-2022 academic year semester 2**.

- Stochastic Calculus ([PDF](notes_files/stochastic_calculus.pdf)): This
  course is lectured by [Professor Goran
  Peskir](https://personalpages.manchester.ac.uk/staff/goran.peskir/)
  during **2022--2023 academic year semester 1**. The notes provided by
  the lecturer is handwritten with huge amount of extra knowledge,
  therefore I decide to retype the notes via Latex and remove all the
  non-examinable materials.
